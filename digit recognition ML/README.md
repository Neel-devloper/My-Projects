Run the init weights and biases.py to generate random weights and biases for the model to start with.
Then run train.py to train the model on 40,000 actual 28 by 28 mnist dataset images which may take 2-3 hours.
Then you can run use.py to use the trained model which will take 20 random images from the the dataset (unseen images) and predict what they are.
If you want a more accurate prediction then you can increase the number of images it goes through.
